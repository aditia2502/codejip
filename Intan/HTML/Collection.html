<center><h1> The Met Collection </h1></center>
<br><br><br>

<p>When The Met was founded in 1870, it owned not a single work of art. Through the combined efforts of generations of curators, researchers, and collectors, our collection has grown to represent more than 5,000 years of art from across the globeâ€”from the first cities of the ancient world to the works of our time.</p>
